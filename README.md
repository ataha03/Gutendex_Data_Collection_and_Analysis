# Gutendex_Data_Collection_and_Analysis
For this task, I will be collecting, preparing, analysing, and discussing data from Gutendex - a digital library of books available from Project Gutenberg. Gutendex offers an accessible and simple API for extracting information on books. API endpoint: https://gutendex.com/.

We can see that books were not very popular before the 1500s. The surge in book popularity after the 1500s can be attributed to the invention of the printing press by Gutenberg around 1440 AD. With the mass production of books and the subsequent rise in literacy rates, reading became widespread, leading to a significant increase in the popularity of books. 

To visually capture this historical trend, I will generate an updated graph focusing on the period between 1440 and 2000. This timeframe marks a pivotal era in the evolution of literature, reflecting the profound impact of printing technology on book accessibility and readership.

Books were incredibly more frequent at this time period, mirroring the impact of the printing press. The spike of download counts near the 1570s is from the play "Romeo and Juliet" by Shakespeare, which is the most commonly downloaded book in the Gutendex. We can also see that books were most common between the 1800s and 1900s. The increase in frequency of books at this time is due to technological advancements in the printing press. The printing press became more mechanised and more widely adopted, triggering a revolution in paper production and book publishing.
